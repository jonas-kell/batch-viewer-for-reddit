### Purpose

Backup a bunch of reddit posts into one singular file to be able to view it offline.

Later go through the posts while on the train or on vacation without internet.

Many convenience features could be added, but at th moment this is just for my fun of developing and not even the most capable solution on github.

Supports encryption, as I wanted an experiment to play around with the 'crypto' api.

### Local testing

Run in the base of the project:

```cmd
python3 -m http.server 8080 --bind 127.0.0.1
```
