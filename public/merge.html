        <h2>Merge Collections</h2>

        This is only supported on chrome currently (no mobile), because it requires an api that is not available to basically
        every other browser.<br />

        <button id="open_zip">Open Zip</button><br />
        Make sure to only merge collections with the same encryption key to have no limited viewing experience.
